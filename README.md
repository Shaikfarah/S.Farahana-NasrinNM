# AI-Powered Disease Prediction System

## Overview
This project aims to enhance healthcare outcomes by using AI to predict potential diseases based on patient data such as symptoms, demographics, and medical history. The system leverages machine learning algorithms to assist medical professionals in early diagnosis and decision support.

## Objectives
- Predict diseases based on structured patient data.
- Apply classification models to identify the most probable conditions.
- Improve accuracy and recall to ensure reliability.
- Provide insights into feature importance (e.g., which symptoms are most indicative of specific diseases).

## Technologies
- Python, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- ML Models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression

## How to Use
1. Load the dataset
2. Run `source_code.py`
3. View prediction output and model evaluation metrics
